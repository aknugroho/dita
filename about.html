<p>Hello Everyone :)</p> 
 <p>My name is Eunike Ardytasari, you can call me Eunike, Nike or Dita.</p>

<p>I really like reading and writing. That’s why I made this blog
  to share my stories, thinking, journey and another things else. Most of my post are about mental health. 
 Because I want to spread Mental Health Awareness through my writings.</p>
  
  <p>My dream is not only to write and to share everything but also to bless and to encourage all people who read my writings 
  on this blog or my other channels. I am not a perfect person, many times I am weak and fail. But I often found a new hope from 
    some readings, so I just want to do the same thing, to share and to help other people finding their HOPE.</p>
