<p>Today I realized that my illness affect my spiritual life too. I feel that I am far from God. 
I feel lazy to read Bible even going to church. I don't know why. I try so hard to keep doing my spiritual discipline,
but I feel difficult when other part of my life is sick.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">God is never quiet</h2>

<p>I have experienced this condition quite long and I feel tired. But today when my friends and I read a Bible verse in our group,
I realized that God is not far and God is never quiet.</p> 
    
<blockquote class="blockquote">Disciple so often get into trouble; still, God is there every time. (Psalm 34:19,MSG)</blockquote></p>

<p> Knowing that God is there every time gave me a new hope. He is there in every trouble I face, 
He is there when I feel down, He is there when I feel alone and He is there every time. I am not alone. 
    I have God who will always help me.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">There is life when there is HOPE</h2>
<p>Remember that we often get into troubles. But whatever our situation now, how difficult our trouble is, let's not give up.
There is hope for us. Because God is there every time with us. Let's standing strong with God.</p>
