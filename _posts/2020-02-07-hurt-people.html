<p>Today I experienced that and now I understand why people said “hurt people hurt people”. Since this morning my mood was bad.
    I went to office and work as usual. After lunch we had meeting to prepare our teaching next week. 
    Because it’s a new semester, our coordinator asked  all of us to choose which class we want to teach. 
    They can choose different class, but at the end I can’t choose different class because all my friends didn’t want to teach at my class. 
    I feel disappointed because why should she asked me if at the end I didn’t have any choice. I feel angry, that’s not fair. 
    My friends, they can say no and choose what they want. But me, I can’t say no. So, while the meeting I was really angry.</p>

<p> Before I got home I decided to buy Ice cream first to make my mood quite better. I remember my roommate and bought one ice cream for her too. 
    I want to make her happy by bringing ice cream for her. After I got home we start eating the ice cream and suddenly she said that she wants to taste mine. 
    Suddenly I shouted to her and said why didn’t you feel satisfied with that ice cream. I have bought that for you and still you want more. 
    After I said that I relized that I hurt her. She looks so sad.  </p>

<p>I know it’s only simple story, but I want to share how dangerous is when we feel hurt. 
    How dangerous the anger is when we keep that inside, it can explode anytime and hurt people around us. 
    Today I learn, when people hurt me, I feel pain. I should not let people I love feel that pain also because of my pain. 
    When we feel hurt it’s better to express that thru crying, talking with someone or other things. 
    When we feel hurt we can choose to be heal or if not we will hurt others. </p> 


    <p> Today I also learn when I feel hurt I should try to understand their perspective too. 
        Most of people around me, they didn't mean to hurt me otherwise they do love me. 
        But sometimes I just can't see that because I focus too much on my pain.</p>
