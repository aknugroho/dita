<p>As of 8 May 2020, the Government of the Republic of Indonesia has reported 13.112 persons with confirmed COVID-19. 
There have been 943 deaths related to COVID-19 reported and 2.494 patients have recovered from the disease. 
Indonesia is in a tough spot now because Covid-19 affect every part of our lives.</p> 
<p>
For me personally it’s a hard time to just stay at home, can’t meet many people, can’t go to many places. I feel tired of feeling bored. 
I feel so lonely sometimes and feel worried about many things. So many changes happened and I don’t even can to plan many things for the future because we don’t know when is this pandemic will be end. This uncertainity is killing me. I am angry to this situation buta t the end I can’t do noting. I hate this feeling and it began to kill my hope little by little. 
And without Hope I can’t survive in the midst of this pandemic, in this war. 
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">So, how to keep our hope alive in the midst of this pandemic? Let’s learn together.</h2>


<h2 class="section-heading"> 1.	Grow our Friend Group – Even from home</h2>

<p>
We can’t survive alone, we need an encouraging community especially in this condition. 
So ho do we do that? Start by being a friend. We want to have a friend who will encourage us, then become an encourager. 
Want friends who will help us grow as a person? Then practice listening, and show that we’re willing to change when we learn new things. 
Whatever we want to see in others, work towards becoming that friend ourselves. 
</p>

<p>
Start praying for others everyday. Take time to pray for ourself and for friends. 
When we pray regularly for other people, our emphathy and concern for them grows. 
Then  when our emphaty to other grows it will grow our hope too. We get a hopeful life when we give impact for other’s lives.
</p>

<p>
Start having honest conversations. Relationship are built on both dirrections trust. 
Being open about our condition to our friends. Being honest when we need help. 
But not only about us. Ask a lot of questions, actively listen and don’t judge.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading"> 2.	Stay positive </h2>

<p>
It’s important to stay positive if we want to keep our hope alive. 
Become positive is not only having positive thingking but more than that. 
It means we keep on believing God in this situation. Become positive means don not live by what we see. 
Become positive means choosing not to listen too much to bad news. 
</p>



<h2 class="section-heading"> 3.	Be productive   </h2>

<p>
 Having  passion and try to make it come thru will make us living this life with full of hope. 
 Also when we lose our passion we are starting to lose our hope too. 
 In the midst of this pandemic let’s see this time as an opportunity to be more productive. 
 We have a lot of time to stay at home. Use our time wisely. Try to make schedule or to do list everyday. 
 Being productive is not about how many things you do but about how effective you are. 
 When we do some things to reach our goals, we are productive. 
 If you feel lazy or just want to spend a lot of time doing nothing just remind yourself to not waste your time. 
 Try to do your hobby, explore or improve your talent. 
 Produce something useful according to your passion and goals.
