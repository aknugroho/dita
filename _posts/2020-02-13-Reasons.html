<p>It’s okay if people say love doesn’t need reasons. I appreciate them. 
But for me I need reason to love you because it’s not only about love but also about trust to decide that 
  I want to spend my life with you. 
That’s why I don’t want to love you blindy. I have these 100 reasons to love you. Isn’t it enough to keep survive and to keep loving you? 
By writing these reasons made me feel so blessed and thankful that God gave you in my life.</p> 
<p>Thank you mahal, I love you <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gerard.villanueva.1238" target="_blank">Gerard Villanueva.</a>.</p>
