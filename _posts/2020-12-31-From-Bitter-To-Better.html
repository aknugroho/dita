<p><i>“He has filled me with bitterness; he has sated me with wormwood. He has made my teeth grind on gravel, 
and made me cower in ashes; my soul is bereft of peace; I have forgotten what happiness is.” 
Lamentations 3:15-17 (ESV)</i></p> 

<p>
Jeremiah’s words in Lamentations 3:15-17, captured my ached in my heart. That word, 
“wormwood,” it’s a shrubby plant — la’anah in Hebrew — and most noted for its intense bitterness. 
The Greeks used the word absinthion, which means “undrinkable.” 
</p>

<p>
And just like its bitter taste, wormwood appears frequently in the Bible to symbolize unpalatable bitterness and sorrow in life. 
In this season of my own life, especially this year, I felt much like Jeremiah — chowing down of wormwood every day. 
</p>

<p>
I did not expect that this pandemic would last so long. It is almost the end of the year, but COVID-19 is still spreading here in my country. 
</p>

<p>
Living in the middle of pandemic it’s really difficult and I experienced compounding feelings of bitterness. 
Yep I feel bitter about what’s happening and I don’t even know if it can be better. The most difficult thing is to live with uncertainty. 
Because of this pandemic I couldn’t do many things I have planned before. 
And the worst is I can’t even make another plan because everything is uncertain in this pandemic.  
</p>

<p>
For me it’s extremely difficult. Because I am a kind of person who like everything be well organized. 
I like to make plan for everything, make sure that everything will be organized. But when the pandemic came, it ruined everything. 
And we don’t even know when this pandemic will be end. Day by day, I live my life with anger, worry about future, doubt, frustate because of this uncertainty. 
</p>

<p>
Also I was really sad when my fiance and I decided to puspone our wedding day, because there is no way to do that while this pandemic is still happening. 
I felt disappointed, mad and it put more bitterness in my heart. When my heart felt bitter, 
I became so negative, couldn’t see any good thing or grateful and even to be happy for other people’s happiness it’s really difficult.  
It really need times to finnaly accept the condition and decided to move from bitter to a better life. 
I didn’t want to stay in this bitterness because bitterness and holiness cannot dwell in the same heart.</p>
