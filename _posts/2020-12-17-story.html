<h2 class="section-heading"> December, 17 2020 </h2>

<p>One day before I leave this special city. 
Suddenly a sweet and lovely girl gave me a gift and said thank you for what I have did to her. 
This simply but precious gift make me realized that everything we did to others matters.</p> 

<p>
Sometimes we don’t realized how precious our lives for others. 
We didn’t even realized that what we did become impact to others. 
</p>

<p>
I am thankful for this meaningful live. Now I know that every little things I do is never wasted.
